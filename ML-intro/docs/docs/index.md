# Introduction

**Heidi Putkuri**

I am first year student in [KAMK Data science and Machine Learning](https://kamk.fi/koulutukset/tieto-ja-viestintatekniikan-insinoori-datasta-tekoalyyn-paakaupunkiseutu-monimuoto/) program and also finishing my [Master of Science in Life Science Informatics](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/degree-programmes/life-science-informatics-masters-programme) in the University of Helsinki. Only my master thesis is missing from the degree, which I'm currently working on. Trying to create a simple taxonomic classifier using methylation data from microbial samples. I have studied machine learning and data science in my masters mostly in very theoretical level and in the biological context. I am very excited to learn more about the practical side and deepen my knowledge in this field.
